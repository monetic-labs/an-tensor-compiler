This product includes software developed at Monetic Labs.

This work draws on ideas from several fields and researchers:

NEURO-SYMBOLIC AI & TENSOR LOGIC
  Pedro Domingos — "Every Model Learned by Gradient Descent Is Approximately
  a Kernel Machine" (arXiv:2012.00152) and foundational work on unifying
  logical and statistical AI. The Tensor Logic compiler's approach to
  compiling symbolic rules into differentiable tensor equations is directly
  informed by Domingos' research on bridging symbolic and subsymbolic systems.

FUZZY LOGIC
  Lotfi Zadeh — Fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic (1965). The differentiable
  fuzzy operators (AND, OR, NOT, IMPLIES) that form the foundation of
  the rule compiler are grounded in Zadeh's continuous-valued logic.

HOLOGRAPHIC REDUCED REPRESENTATIONS
  Tony Plate — "Holographic Reduced Representations" (1995). The HRR
  module implements Plate's circular convolution binding and correlation
  unbinding for distributed representations of structured information.

BIOMIMICRY & NATURAL SYSTEMS
  The architecture of this project draws from biological patterns not as
  metaphor, but as structural principle. Organisms, bounded contexts,
  federation, holographic memory, and gradient isolation reflect how
  biological systems achieve robustness through composition, locality,
  and distributed representation. We study natural systems to find
  paradigms that actually work, not to borrow aesthetics.
